                    <h3>LDAP Authentication</h3>
                    <p>LDAP authentication allows database users to log into dedicated (M10 or higher) Atlas clusters using credentials that are verified by a LDAP server you control. Database users can be configured in the project-level Access Manager.</p>
                    <p>Turning on this feature will increase your daily cluster pricing. Read more.</p>

                    <h3>LDAP Authorization (LDAP Authentication required)</h3>
                    <p>LDAP authorization allows database users to be managed at LDAP group level. LDAP groups can be managed in the project-level Access Manager and be assigned a specific set of privileges. All database users in an LDAP group can then authenticate to dedicated (M10 or higher) Atlas clusters with those privileges.</p>

                    <p>Newly deployed clusters will use your encryption key by default. Pre-existing clusters will not use your encryption key until you enable them individually. This feature will increase your daily cluster pricing. Read more.</p>
